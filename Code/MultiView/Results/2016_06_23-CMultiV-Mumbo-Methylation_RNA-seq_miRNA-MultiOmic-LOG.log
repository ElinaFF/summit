Mumbo classification using DecisionTreeas weak classifier with depth 1.

 Learning on 
	- Methylation RNA-seq miRNA as features
	- No Yes as labels
	- 200 training examples, 147 testing examples (0.8 rate)

 With configuration :
	- 30 iterations on Mumbo
	- 3 cores used for computing.

The algorithm took : 
	- 0:00:59.492454 to extract the database,
	- 0:00:57.523216 to learn on 200 examples and 3 views,
	- 0:00:00.677186 to predict on 347 examples
So a total classification time of 0:01:57.692858.
